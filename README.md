This is a web-based app where users can analyse their Spotify playlists to learn more about their listening habits.

This web app is written in Python and built upon the web framework dash plotly. 

Data is pulled through Spotify API's wrapper - Spotipy.

The final aim of the app hopes to provide users with insights into their playlists in a comprehensive and intutive manner.
